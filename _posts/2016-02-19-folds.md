description: 'A three storey period terrace house in North London, appealed for a scheme that would open up views to the adjoining Parkland Walk conservation area. The focal point of the project is a pleated roof at the back of the house, which appears to be formed from a flat surface, forced to crinkle up into a faceted structure, as it is pushed up against the exterior wall.'
