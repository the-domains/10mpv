description: "The 54m 2 extension to a house in the Parkland Walk conservation area features a 'pleated roof', which according to the architect 'appears to be formed of a flat surface forced to crinkle up into a faceted structure'. From the garden the folds of the roof are hidden from view giving the impression of a simple flat roof."
